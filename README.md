### Download

for OSX download the [binary file for OSX](https://github.com/kingsleyh/tracksuit/raw/master/bin/tracksuit) and put it the same directory as your .deft folder

Then chmod +x tracksuit

and open it with ./tracksuit

### Bugs

The scroll bars are not aware. So when the list items change you need to resize the window a bit for the scroll bars to leap into action and realise stuff has changed.
